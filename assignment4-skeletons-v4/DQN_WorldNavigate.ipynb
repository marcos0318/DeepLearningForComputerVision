This second network is used to generate the target-Q values that will be used to compute the loss for every action during training. Why not use just use one network for both estimations? The issue is that at every step of training, the Q-networkâ€™s values shift, and if we are using a constantly shifting set of values to adjust our network values, then the value estimations can easily spiral out of control. The network can become destabilized by falling into feedback loops between the target and estimated Q-values. In order to mitigate that risk, the target networkâ€™s weights are fixed, and only periodically or slowly updated to the primary Q-networks values. In this way training can proceed in a more stable manner."

The Q-values that we have been discussing so far correspond to how good it is to take a certain action given a certain state. This can be written as `Q(s,a)`. This action given state can actually be decomposed into two more fundamental notions of value. The first is the value function `V(s)`, which says simple how good it is to be in any given state. The second is the advantage function `A(a)`, which tells how much better taking a certain action would be compared to the others. We can then think of `Q` as being the combination of `V` and `A`.

It may seem somewhat pointless to do this at first glance. Why decompose a function that we will just put back together? The key to realizing the benefit is to appreciate that our reinforcement learning agent may not need to care about both value and advantage at any given time. We can achieve more robust estimates of state value by decoupling it from the necessity of being attached to specific actions."

    "The main intuition behind Double DQN is that the regular DQN often overestimates the Q-values of the potential actions to take in a given state. While this would be fine if all actions were always overestimates equally, there was reason to believe this wasnâ€™t the case. You can easily imagine that if certain suboptimal actions regularly were given higher Q-values than optimal actions, the agent would have a hard time ever learning the ideal policy. In order to correct for this, the authors of DDQN paper propose a simple trick: instead of taking the max over Q-values when computing the target-Q value for our training step, we use our primary network to chose an action, and our target network to generate the target Q-value for that action. By decoupling the action choice from the target Q-value generation, we are able to substantially reduce the overestimation, and train faster and more reliably. Below is the new DDQN equation for updating the target value.\n"
